Dummy data isn’t exactly dumb — on the contrary. Analysts that use dummy data are often the smart ones in the room, since dummy data is kind a safety mechanism for data integrity. It’s a trial subject of sorts, applied to unknown programs, or program modifications, before valuable data is used.

OK, that’s a high-level view, but what is dummy data really?
